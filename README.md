# IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate Project - John Wick
This is a portfolio project page I created for the [IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer). The tast was to create a portfolio page for a client and so I though of John Wick being the client. Hope you like! Feel free to send a PR.
